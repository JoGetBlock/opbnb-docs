For example, a game like Crypto Blades on BSC with 300K daily active users and 18 million transactions per day can overload the BNB Smart Chain, leading to unacceptable gas fees and network responsiveness.\nThe gas fees of these Layer 1 chains are still too expensive for most games and applications, which usually prefer low or no fees. A single game with 1 million daily active users could spend thousands of BNB on gas fees during peak periods. Layer 2 scaling solutions built on top of Layer 1 chains offer a solution. They can provide high throughput beyond Layer 1 constraints. The opBNB network is built on OP Stack and designed for over 4,000 TPS and gas fees under $0.005 on average for transfer transactions.\nBy offloading transaction processing and resource usage to Layer 2 while still securely posting data to the underlying BNB Smart Chain, applications gain major throughput benefits without sacrificing decentralisation or composability. Layer 2 solutions are suitable for applications where scale and user experience are crucial, such as games, social networks, the metaverse, and high-frequency trading.

It works by offloading transaction processing and resource usage from the BNB Smart Chain, while still posting data to the underlying mainnet. Users interact with the opBNB network by depositing funds from BSC and using applications and contracts on opBNB. Sequencers then aggregate transactions, compute state transitions and submit them to the rollup contract on BSC. Provers generate cryptographic proofs that prove the validity of these state transitions, and Verifiers check the proofs to verify the opBNB state is correct. At its core, opBNB allows users to deposit and withdraw funds, use smart contracts, and view network data with high throughput and low fees.
