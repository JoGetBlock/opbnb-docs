It works by offloading transaction processing and resource usage from the BNB Smart Chain, while still posting data to the underlying mainnet. Users interact with the opBNB network by depositing funds from BSC and using applications and contracts on opBNB. Sequencers then aggregate transactions, compute state transitions and submit them to the rollup contract on BSC. Provers generate cryptographic proofs that prove the validity of these state transitions, and Verifiers check the proofs to verify the opBNB state is correct. At its core, opBNB allows users to deposit and withdraw funds, use smart contracts, and view network data with high throughput and low fees. By leveraging Layer 2, opBNB is able to scale beyond the constraints of the BNB Smart Chain and provide an improved experience for users.","sidebar":"guideSidebar"},"intro/why-opbnb":{"id":"intro/why-opbnb","title":"Why do we need opBNB","description":"Learn why opBNB is needed","sidebar":"guideSidebar"},"tech-specs/censorship-resistence":{"id":"tech-specs/censorship-resistence","title":"The sequencer and censorship resistence mechnism","description":""},"tech-specs/parameters":{"id":"tech-specs/parameters","title":"Core Parameters you may want to know","description":"This is a living document and is susceptible to changes."},"tech-specs/plans":{"id":"tech-specs/plans","title":"Future Plans (2023)","description":"This is a living document and is susceptible to changes."},"tech-specs/solidity-difference":{"id":"tech-specs/solidity-difference","title":"Solidity differences from Ethereum and BSC","description":""},"tutorials/full-stack-dapp":{"id":"tutorials/full-stack-dapp","title":"Create a Full Stack dapp using Truffle and React on opBNB","description":"Build Full Stack dapp using Truffle and React on opBNB","sidebar":"guideSidebar"},"tutorials/running-a-local-development-environment":{"id":"tutorials/running-a-local-development-environment","title":"Running a local development environment","description":"Guide to running a local development environment","sidebar":"guideSidebar"},"tutorials/running-a-testnet-node":{"id":"tutorials/running-a-testnet-node","title":"Running a Testnet Node","description":"Guide to running opBNB Testnet Node","sidebar":"guideSidebar"}}}')}}]);
