Networks like BNB Smart Chain, Ethereum, and Polygon were not designed to handle the high transaction volumes and intensive daily active users of these applications. For example, a game like Crypto Blades on BSC with 300K daily active users and 18 million transactions per day can overload the BNB Smart Chain, leading to unacceptable gas fees and network responsiveness.\nThe gas fees of these Layer 1 chains are still too expensive for most games and applications, which usually prefer low or no fees. A single game with 1 million daily active users could spend thousands of BNB on gas fees during peak periods. Layer 2 scaling solutions built on top of Layer 1 chains offer a solution. They can provide high throughput beyond Layer 1 constraints. The opBNB network is built on OP Stack and designed for over 4,000 TPS and gas fees under $0.005 on average for transfer transactions.\nBy offloading transaction processing and resource usage to Layer 2 while still securely posting data to the underlying BNB Smart Chain, applications gain major throughput benefits without sacrificing decentralisation or composability. Layer 2 solutions are suitable for applications where scale and user experience are crucial, such as games, social networks, the metaverse, and high-frequency trading.
