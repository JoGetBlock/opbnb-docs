Networks like BNB Smart Chain, Ethereum, and Polygon were not designed to handle the high transaction volumes and intensive daily active users of these applications. For example, a game like Crypto Blades on BSC with 300K daily active users and 18 million transactions per day can overload the BNB Smart Chain, leading to unacceptable gas fees and network responsiveness.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"opBNB-for-developers/core-concepts":{"id":"opBNB-for-developers/core-concepts","title":"Core Concepts","description":"What is Layer 2 on BSC","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"opBNB-for-developers/developer-tools":{"id":"opBNB-for-developers/developer-tools","title":"Developer Tools","description":"Networks, Public RPC Endpoints, & APIs","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"opBNB-for-developers/faq-for-developers":{"id":"opBNB-for-developers/faq-for-developers","title":"FAQ for Developers","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"opBNB-for-developers/Getting-Started":{"id":"opBNB-for-developers/Getting-Started","title":"Getting Started","description":"Developing on opBNB, an optimistic rollup Layer 2 scaling solution for BNB Smart Chain, is nearly the same as building directly on BNB Smart Chain. opBNB uses an EVM execution engine, meaning decentralized applications can be migrated from Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, and other EVM-compatible chains without changing any code.Some key points to highlight:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"opBNB-for-operators/concepts":{"id":"opBNB-for-operators/concepts","title":"Concepts","description":"- Running a Node","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Tech-specs/concepts":{"id":"Tech-specs/concepts","title":"concepts","description":"- Overview","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
