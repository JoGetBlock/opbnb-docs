Networks like BNB Smart Chain, Ethereum, and Polygon were not designed to handle the high transaction volumes and intensive daily active users of these applications. For example, a game like Crypto Blades on BSC with 300K daily active users and 18 million transactions per day can overload the BNB Smart Chain, leading to unacceptable gas fees and network responsiveness.","sidebar":"guideSidebar"},"release-notes/releaseNotes":{"id":"release-notes/releaseNotes","title":"Release Notes","description":"Greenfield v0.2.1 - Mekong Testnet reset."}}}')}}]);
